%KERN-HV(1) Version 0.2 | Berrymill Documentation

NAME
====

**kern-hv** â€” plugin for creating images, based on Kernkonzept Hypervisor

SYNOPSIS
========

| **kern-hv** \[-h|\--help]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Plugin for the Berrymill framework, which is designed to construct
booting image on QEMU or hardware, including a l4re Hypervisor from
Kernkonzept[1].

The **kern-hv** plugin can be used alone separately, or can be chained
within the **workflow** plugin.

FILES
=====

As any **berrymill** plugin, the whole configuration is in the common
`project.conf` file, which should be placed to the root of the current
project. This file contains all configuration for all possible plugins
and defines everything.

CONFIGURATION
=============

Working image(s) are always defined in the `project.conf` file at the
beginning of it, in the section `-general` (note the leading "minus")
and the list `images`. Each list item in the `images` is a directory
with `dir://` schema, telling Berrymill where to look for the
images. Image files can be only named with `.qcow2` or `.raw` file
extensions. The section `images` should contain **at least one**
path. Scheme `dir://my/path` refers to a *relative* path as `my/path`.
An absolute path should have three slashes, like `dir:///my/path`.

Example:

```
-general:
  images:
    - dir://at/least/one/path/to/my/images
    - dir://another/optional/path/to/my/images
	- dir:///this/is/an/absolute/path
```

As any other plugin, the specific section starts from the same **id**
of the plugin, namely `kern-hv`. Following is the list of top-level
configuration items.

* `output-dir`

The `output-dir` is an optional item and defines subdirectory name,
located in the same directory as `project.conf` file.

Default value is `build`.

* `output-image`

The `output-image` is a filename of the resulting image, which will be
placed in the `output-dir` destination alongside with other artefacts.

* `hypervisor`

This section is for hypervisor data configuration. It requires many
different items, such as bootstrap image, the device tree files, Lua
scripts and other artifacts.

* `image-map`

Section `image-map` is a technically any _key_ to any _value_, and
only defines symlinks to the already known image, those are scanned
prior in the `-general` section. For example, if the hypervisor is
configured to write `example.raw` image and in `-general` section is
found a system, like `demo-image.aarch64-1.0.raw`, then in order to
hypervisor pick it up, it should be configured like so:

```
image-map:
  example.raw: demo-image.aarch64-1.0.raw
```

In this case, `example.raw` will be just a symlink to the
`demo-image.aarch64-1.0.raw` file in temporary build directory.

# OPTION "hypervisor"

This option has four sections that puts together the main hypervisor
configuration.

* `bootstrap-image`

An original, default bootstrap U-Boot image, which is going to be
repackaged with your configuration.

* `device-tree`

Directory where all device tree and metadata is located.

* `hv-conf`

Path to the directory, containing configuration in Lua scripts.

* `hv-conf-entry`

Name of the main entry in the metadata dependencies file.

# OPTION "part-data"

This is a key/value mapping and should correspond to the configuration
in Lua scripts. Please refer to the Kernkonzept configuration
documentation to know more details.

Those files are usually used for VM partitions, those can be
many. Same as `image-map`, the `part-data` option refers to the
following schema:

```
filename_in_lua_script: file://path/to/an/actual/filename
```

Usually the hypervisor expects Linux kernel and `initrd` file per a
partition. So in the Lua scripts one would usually configure those
files before starting a VM, such as `my_ramdisk` and
`my_kernel`. Therefore the configuration would look like this:

```
part-data:
  my_ramdisk: file:///path/to/my-image-1.0.initrd
  my_kernel: file:///path/to/my-image-1.0.kernel
```

# OPTION "image-layout"

This option refers to the `embdgen` library and has its own
documentation, available online[2] or `embdgen` manpage.

Configuration of this section is not covered in this manpage.
