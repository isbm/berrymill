**berrymill** â€” generate a root file system for embedded devices

SYNOPSIS

| **berrymill** \[global options] action \<command\> \[\<args>]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**berrymill** is an appliance generator of root file systems for embedded devices.
It is a wrapper around **kiwi**(8) and allows to build images equally on
[OBS](https://openbuildservice.org) **and** locally without changes to the
image description.

Also **berrymill** implements the concept of _derived images_ to extend kiwi
image descriptions with small derivations like adding or removing packages,
changing the size or the type of a file system. To do so simply create a xml file
that inherits the original image description (or an already derived one) and
add wanted content.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<image schemaversion="6.8" name="Testname">
    <inherit path="config.xml"/>

    ....
</image>

```

Important xml tags for derived images are:

* "add": Add specific data to the derived image like a package, or
  other elements. Example:

```
<add>
   <packages type="iso">
         <package name="dracut-kiwi-live"/>
   </packages>
</add>
```

* "remove": Remove parts of the original image in the derived image, could be
  e.g., packages, aggregates... Example:

```
<remove>
   <packages type="image">
         <package name="iptables"/>
   </packages>
</remove>
```

* "merge" and "replace": Merge and replace only work on aggregates. One could
  for example, merge an additional `type` element to the `preferences`:

```
<merge>
    <preferences>
        <type image="typename" primary="true"/>
    </preferences>
</merge>
```

* "remove\_any": Remove any element from description that matches by attributes
   at least. In contrast to `remove`, this does not need precise tag description.
   Instead it is considering attributes to narrow down what tags to remove from
   the description. For example, it is possible to use it to remove all users
   configured with plain password format:

```
<remove_any>
  <user  pwdformat="plain"/>
</remove_any>
```

* "set": Set attributes on an element in the derived image to add or update
   attributes on a specific tag. Example:

```
<set xpath="//packages[@type='image']">
     profiles: some_profile
</set>
```

See a more complex example under EXAMPLES.

OPTIONS
=======

For **berrymill** the following options are available, irrespective whether
*prepare* or *build* is chosen:

-h, --help

: Prints brief usage information.

-s, \--show-config

: Show the build configuration. The default configuration used by **berrymill**
resides in */etc/berrymill/berrymill.conf*. Alternative configurations can be
loaded with **-c**. See below as well.

-d, \--debug

: Turns on verbose debugging mode for **berrymill.** It will also pass
**\--box-debug** to the boxbuild. This will cause the box not to shut
down after the build finished.

-a ARCH, \--arch ARCH

: Sets target architecture e.g., aarch64.

-c CONFIG, \--config CONFIG

: Specify a configuration file other than the default one. Expects a configuration
file as argument. Read more about the structure of configuration files in
section [FILES](#files).

-i IMAGE, \--image IMAGE

: Path to the image description, this parameter is required.
For more information on kiwi consult **kiwi**(8).

-p PROFILE, \--profile PROFILE

: Select a profile from the image description. If more than one is provided
in the image description and this parameter is not provided the build will
fail.

\--clean

: When \--clean is passed **berrymill** will cleanup previous build results like
the target directory.

When **berrymill** is executed with the option *prepare* to prepare the sysroot
the following options are additionally available.

\--root ROOT

: Specifies path where the root system shall be created. This is passed along
to **kiwi::system::prepare**(8). This parameter is required for *prepare*.

\--allow-existing-root

: Allow to re-use an existing image root directory. This parameter is passed
along to **kiwi::system::prepare**(8).

When **berrymill** is executed with the option *build* to build the image the
following options are additionally available.

\--box-memory BOX\_MEMORY

: Specify amount of memory to be used by qemu for the boxbuild. The default is
*8G*. This parameter is passed to **kiwi::system::boxbuild**(8).

\--cpu CPU

: Specify CPU type to be used by qemu for the boxbuild. Per default the host
CPU is used. This parameter is passed to **kiwi::system::boxbuild**(8).
This option has no effect in combination with \--cross, as \--cross overwrites
this setting to an appropriate one.

\--cross

: Select \--cross to cross build an image on a x86\_64 host to an aarch64
target.

-l, \--local

: If -l, \--local is selected a local image build on the current architecture
is performed instead of a boxbuild. This will require sudo rights and an
installation of the KIWI tool chain.

\--target-dir TARGET\_DIR

: Specify the directory where the results of the build shall be placed by
**berrymill**. This parameter is required and gets passed along to
**kiwi**(8).

\--no-accel

: Disables the KVM acceleration for boxbuild.

Exit status
-----------

**berrymill** returns 0 on success else 1.

FILES
=====

* */etc/berrymill/berrymill.conf*

This file defines the repositories that **berrymill** uses to build the image.
An example structure is given in the following.

```
use-global-repos: false
boxed_plugin_conf: <path_to_boxplugin_conf>
repos:
  release:
    <target_architecture_1>
      <repo_alias>:
        url:  <repo_url>
        type: <repo_type>
        key: <key_file>
        name: <name>
        components: main,universe,...

      ...
    <architecture_2>
...
```

If no key is defined **berrymill** will try to find one, but this only works
for flat repos without components at the moment. If no key is found,
**berrymill** will ask the user which key to use based on their trusted keys.

* */etc/berrymill/kiwi_boxed_plugin.yml*

Contains further configuration for the boxes to be used for the boxbuild.
See also **kiwi::system::boxbuild**(8)

EXAMPLES
========

* Run a build on current architecture

```
sudo berrymill -d -i <image_descr> build -l --target-dir ./result
```

* Run a cross build for aarch64

```
berrymill -d -i <image_descr> build --cross --target-dir ./result
```

* Derived configuration

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<image schemaversion="6.8" name="test">
    <inherit path="config.xml"/>

    <!--
        Remove specific data. Anything inside of the "remove"
        tag should precisely match by attributes.
    -->
    <remove>
        <!--
            Remove a specific package, as only
            the last element is removed, while parents are
            just "qualifiers" to set the proper matching.
        -->
        <packages type="oem">
            <package name="dracut-kiwi-oem-dump"/>
        </packages>

        <!-- Remove the entire aggregate -->
        <packages type="iso" />
    </remove>

    <!--
        Remove any data. Anything inside of the "remove_any"
        tag should at least match by attributes. The less
        specific attributes, the higher is glob matcher.
    -->
    <remove_any>
        <!-- This will remove any "repository" tag that has these attributes -->
        <repository components="main multiverse restricted universe"/>
    </remove_any>

    <!-- Add specific data -->
    <add>
        <packages type="image">
            <package name="package"/>
        </packages>
    </add>

    <!--
        Replace and merge works only on aggregates.
        For individual tags e.g. "<repository/>", it should be first
        removed, then added back.
    -->
    <merge>
        <description type="system">
            <author>Herr Starr</author>
            <license>GLWTS</license>
        </description>
    </merge>

    <!-- This replaces the end-tag without XPath -->
    <replace>
        <packages type="oem">
            <package name="some-package"/>
        </packages>
    </replace>

    <set xpath="//user[@name='root' and @groups='root']">
        pwdformat: plain
        password: linux
    </set>
</image>
```
