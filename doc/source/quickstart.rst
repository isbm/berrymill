Quick Start
===========

Prerequisites
-------------

Kiwi NG should be also installed on your system:

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Installing Kiwi NG from pip

    $ pip install kiwi

Also you need an example content description, so clone the official Kiwi NG image examples:

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Getting an example content description:

    $ git clone https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi

Build Image
-----------

To create your initial image, which serves as a basic system disk image compatible with full virtualization systems such as QEMU, execute the following command:

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Building Image

    $ echo TBD

The resulting image will be placed into the folder ``/tmp/tbd`` with the suffix ``.raw``.


Running an Image
----------------

Operating the resulting image closely mirrors the routine in Kiwi NG as it's generated by it. The process involves booting the operating system. To accomplish this, attach the disk image to a virtual system. In this example, we'll demonstrate using QEMU to boot it:

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Booting Operating System

    $ sudo qemu -boot c \
        -drive file=kiwi-test-image-disk.x86_64-1.15.3.raw,format=raw,if=virtio \
        -m 4096 -serial stdio

Image Configuration
-------------------

Now that the image has been built, it's time to configure it to align with the specific requirements of the final use case.
